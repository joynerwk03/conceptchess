## 2026-07-13 — Neutral analytical explanations

**What:** Removed personification from the explanation layer. Output is now:
verdict ("White is clearly better (+1.45)" / "Forced mate in 2 for Black"),
main factors at the end of the expected line, biggest concept shifts over the
line (tempo excluded as uninstructive), and an explicit residual note when
quiescence tactics beyond the PV make the search score differ from the static
breakdown by >0.60. GUI: breakdown chart labeled with its scope (current
position vs end of expected line), concept items sorted by magnitude.

**Verdict:** ACCEPTED (product change; no strength impact, tests green).

## 2026-07-13 — v0 baseline (initial build)

**What:** Full rewrite from scratch. Concept-sum evaluation (material,
placement/PST, pawn structure, king safety, mobility, activity, tempo) with
enforced faithfulness (explanation == search eval). Negamax search with TT,
MVV-LVA + killers + history, quiescence + delta pruning, null move, check
extension, soft time management. UCI interface, web GUI with live concept
breakdown, Stockfish-verified tactics suite miner.

**Numbers (baseline, this machine):**
- Benchmark (2s/pos): avg depth 6.83 (middlegames 4, endgames 6–17), avg NPS ~38k
- Tactics v1 (24 Stockfish-verified positions, 1s/move): 23/24 = 95.8%
  - suite is capture-heavy; harder suites needed (see ROADMAP)
- No match data yet — first loop session should establish a Stockfish-limited
  anchor (suggest: 20 games vs stockfish:1400 at 0.5s/move) and use
  version-vs-version matches thereafter.

**Verdict:** ACCEPTED (v0 baseline).

**Known weaknesses to attack first:** no LMR/PVS (depth), `_transposition_key`
and mobility are likely hot spots (profile first), endgame technique, tactics
suite too easy.
