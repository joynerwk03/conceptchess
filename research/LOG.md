## 2026-07-13 — Session 1: speed + search (experiments 1–7)

Profiling showed 68% of time in eval, dominated by dict building and f-string
detail lists on the hot path. Fixed that, then attacked search depth.

| # | Hypothesis | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | String-free eval fast path (bitboard EvalContext) | 38.0k → 45.3k NPS | ACCEPTED b185f02 |
| 2 | Qsearch generates captures directly | 45.3k → 51.4k NPS | ACCEPTED |
| 3 | Pawn-keyed caches (pawn structure, king safety) | 51.4k → 55.1k NPS | ACCEPTED |
| 4 | Late move reductions | avg depth 7.0 → 8.2 @2s; tactics 23→24/24 | ACCEPTED |
| 5 | Principal variation search | −2.4% nodes to depth 6 | ACCEPTED |
| 6 | Aspiration windows (±50, ±100) | +0.8% / −0.2% nodes — noise | **REJECTED** |
| 7 | Futility pruning (150/300cp margins, depth ≤2) | −38% nodes to depth 6, −16% time | ACCEPTED |

Notes:
- Node counts at fixed depth are deterministic — use them (not wall-clock NPS)
  to judge search-shaping changes. Script: nodes-to-depth-6 over 4 positions.
- Aspiration windows fail here because iteration-to-iteration score swings
  regularly exceed ±100cp with this eval; revisit only after eval tuning
  stabilizes scores.
- End state: avg depth 8.17 @2s (middlegames 5–6, was 4), 24/24 tactics.
- **Strength gate (exp 8): +11 =7 −2 (72.5%) vs v0 over 20 games ≈ +168 Elo**
  (95% CI ~ +20..+425), 10 openings, both colors, 0.3s/move. GATE PASSED.
- **Absolute anchor: +5 =1 −4 (55%) vs Stockfish-1400 over 10 games at
  0.3s/move → engine ≈ 1435 Elo** (wide CI; re-anchor with 30+ games later).
- The match surfaced a real bug (fixed, committed): when depth 1 didn't finish
  inside the budget, search returned no move and UCI sent an illegal null move.
  Lesson: matches are also integration tests — run them even for "pure speed"
  sessions.

## 2026-07-13 — Neutral analytical explanations

**What:** Removed personification from the explanation layer. Output is now:
verdict ("White is clearly better (+1.45)" / "Forced mate in 2 for Black"),
main factors at the end of the expected line, biggest concept shifts over the
line (tempo excluded as uninstructive), and an explicit residual note when
quiescence tactics beyond the PV make the search score differ from the static
breakdown by >0.60. GUI: breakdown chart labeled with its scope (current
position vs end of expected line), concept items sorted by magnitude.

**Verdict:** ACCEPTED (product change; no strength impact, tests green).

## 2026-07-13 — v0 baseline (initial build)

**What:** Full rewrite from scratch. Concept-sum evaluation (material,
placement/PST, pawn structure, king safety, mobility, activity, tempo) with
enforced faithfulness (explanation == search eval). Negamax search with TT,
MVV-LVA + killers + history, quiescence + delta pruning, null move, check
extension, soft time management. UCI interface, web GUI with live concept
breakdown, Stockfish-verified tactics suite miner.

**Numbers (baseline, this machine):**
- Benchmark (2s/pos): avg depth 6.83 (middlegames 4, endgames 6–17), avg NPS ~38k
- Tactics v1 (24 Stockfish-verified positions, 1s/move): 23/24 = 95.8%
  - suite is capture-heavy; harder suites needed (see ROADMAP)
- No match data yet — first loop session should establish a Stockfish-limited
  anchor (suggest: 20 games vs stockfish:1400 at 0.5s/move) and use
  version-vs-version matches thereafter.

**Verdict:** ACCEPTED (v0 baseline).

**Known weaknesses to attack first:** no LMR/PVS (depth), `_transposition_key`
and mobility are likely hot spots (profile first), endgame technique, tactics
suite too easy.
